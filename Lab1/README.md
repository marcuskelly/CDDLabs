## Lab One – Signalling with Semaphores

You will need to create five files for this lab.
Two containing the Semaphore class declaraation and definition: 
Semaphore.h
Semaphore.cpp
One file for the main function that shows signaling in action.  This main function must create at least two threads where one thread signals the other using a common Semaphore.  This file should be named: signal.cpp
The fourth file is called Makefile and will contain one rule that compiles the code and produces a working executable called signal.
The fifth file is the doxygen project settings file, Doxyfile, that is generated by the doxygen program when run for the first time.
